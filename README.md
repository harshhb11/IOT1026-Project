# IOT1026-Project
Write a description of your `Room` and `Monster` class here.
The Room class is an essential part of the Minotaur's Labyrinth game. It represents a basic room that the hero encounters while exploring the labyrinth. The class has some important features:

Room Type: Each room has a specific type, such as "Harshroom" or "Pit Room." This helps distinguish different rooms in the game.

Activation Status: A room can be active or inactive. An active room contains a monster or an event, while an inactive room is empty. By default, a room is inactive until a monster is added to it.

Monsters and Events: You can add a monster to a room or remove it. This allows for different gameplay experiences with or without monsters.

Sensory Information: The room can provide sensory information to the hero based on their distance from the room. This can include warnings or hints about dangers or valuable items.

Activation and Interactions: When the hero enters a room, it triggers interactions. This can involve fighting a monster or encountering events that affect the hero's progress or well-being.

Display Representation: The room has a visual representation. By default, it appears as an empty room. If a monster is present, its representation is used instead.

Task 2: 

Messi (Minotaur)

Messi is a powerful minotaur that can charge at the hero when activated. During the encounter, Messi will knock the hero into another room, while also moving to a new location in the labyrinth. Be careful when encountering Messi, as he can take away your magic sword if you possess one!
